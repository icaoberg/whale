This repo contains the code for the report

* Cao-Berg, Mercaldo, Sanchez, Tisch and Yakubu. (2002) [The Demographic Effects of Increasing Anthropogenic Noise on Mysticeti Whales](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/32217/BU-1619-M.pdf?sequence=1). 

This report was built as part of our summer research experience at [MTBI](https://mtbi.asu.edu/summerprogram) 2002 under the supervision of Nancy Tisch and [Aziz Yakubu](http://mathematics.coas.howard.edu/faculty/yakubu.html).

## Disclaimer

Be kind. I have not tried running this code since 2003 using whatever version of Matlab was available at the time. I look at my coding style back in the day and cringe.
